## Why {background="#43464B"}
### C19 produced **`a lot`** of research into pandemic behaviours and their determinants


### But there is a substantive `lack of insights` into
  - How these relate to and interact with each other
  - Which factors have the strongest predictive value
  - LMIC specific dynamics
  - Causal links esp in LMICs

# Factors associated with pandemic behaviour formation
- Financial constraints/ economic factors
- Health risk perceptions
- Sociological factors
- Knowledge and Trust
- Cultural factors
- Institutional & political factors 



## Financial constraints/ economic factors
- `Classical economic theory` suggests that individuals make rational choices under constraints, weighing the risk of infection against economic consequences (e.g., staying home vs. working).
- `Health capital model` (Grossman, 1972): Health is treated as an investment, with lower-income individuals discounting future health risks if avoiding them means immediate economic hardship.
- `Prospect theory` (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979): Individuals overweight immediate economic losses, making financially insecure people more likely to work despite health risks.

::: {.callout type='default'}
## Empirical evidence 
EG (Chetty et al., 2020; Papageorge et al., 2021) show that lower-income individuals and workers in precarious jobs were less likely to comply with lockdowns.
:::


## Health risk perceptions
- `Health Belief Model` (Rosenstock, 1974): Compliance is influenced by perceived severity, susceptibility, and benefits of protective actions.
- `Risk perception` (Slovic, 1987): Individuals facing immediate health threats (e.g., seeing loved ones infected) prioritize health over economic concerns.

::: {.callout type='default'}
## Empirical evidence 
E.G. Bartscher et al. (2021) show local infection rates predict compliance better than economic vulnerability; Allcott et al. (2020) find greater COVID-19 information exposure leads to higher adherence.
:::

## Sociological factors
- `Social capital theory`: Stronger community networks lead to more collective action; U.S. counties with higher social capital had lower infection rates.
- `Social influence theory`: Individuals conform to peer behavior, sometimes overriding economic incentives, with political affiliations and community norms influencing compliance.

::: {.callout type='default'}
## Empirical evidence 
E.G. Feelings of mutual obligation encourage compliance, with high-cohesion communities showing greater adherence to health measures (Zimmermann et al., 2022).
:::

## Knowledge and Trust
- The `“knowledge-behavior gap”` occurs when trust and biases interfere with knowledge-driven compliance.
- `Trust in institutions`: Compliance is higher when people trust expert sources, while peer/social media influence can sometimes outweigh expert advice.

::: {.callout type='default'}
## Empirical evidence 
Source of information matters: Walter & Xue (2024) find individuals believe information aligning with pre-existing views.
Accurate knowledge helps individuals adopt appropriate behaviors (Baumgartner, 2023; Fadel et al., 2021).
:::

## Cultural factors
- Religion
- Etc

## Institutional & political factors 
`Institutional trust` (Fukuyama, 1995): High-trust societies show higher compliance, independent of financial constraints or personal risk perceptions.

::: {.callout type='default'}
## Empirical evidence 
Government policy & enforcement: Countries with higher institutional trust exhibited greater compliance across income levels.

# Theoretical Frameworks that (don't) connect these factors
## Frameworks: Theory of plnned behaviour

# Chapter: Comparative structural modelling to inform a theory of pandemic behaviour
## What: Comparing and Extending TPB & HBM
::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
- Some studies used HBM `OR` TPB to analyse survey data
- Only REFERENCE in LMIC (Looking at students in Turkey)
- No paper integrating/ extending these in C19 in LMIC
- No study comparing different geographical contexts
- No comparison of NPI and vaccines

## Where: Global comparison
### Comparing contexts across Africa, Latin America, Asia

## How: Structural Equation Modelling I

### Structural Equation Modelling
- Statistical technique that models complex relationships between observed (measured) and latent (unobserved) variables
  - Allows simultaneous estimation of direct and indirect effects in predicting preventive behavior
- Direct, indirect, and total effects analysed for all models
- Conducted at different waves for robustness checks and comparison

## How: Structural Equation Modelling II


### Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) 
- To validate latent constructs
- To operationalise constructs from survey items

### Comparative Model Evaluation
- Predictive power assessment (variance explained in preventative behavior)
- Multi-group SEM for cross-country/SES/gender comparisons
- Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) & Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model comparison


## With: Meta/MIT C19 preventative health survey
### Data
- Conducted via online surveys distributed to Facebook users globally
- Over 100k observations across 78 countries
- Weighted to account for probability of being FB user
- Contains data on all aforementioned factors
- Repeated cross sectional survey

## Why: Contributions
### Emprical contribution
- First large scale SEM across countries and waves
- Qunatification of uncertainity and relative importance of factors

### Theoretical Contribution
- Informing more comprehensive framework of pandemic behaviour

### Policy relevance
- Informs more efficient data collections during early phases of emergencies
- Informs ressource allocation efficiency

# Chapter: Income vs health preservation
## What: Testing the trade-off assumption
### Widely assumed trade-off that `individuals` face
- Rationale behind cash transfer programmes
- Supported by economic theory
  - Grossman (19X)
  - Prospect Theory
- Empirical eveidence shows
  - Effects of income
  - Effects of risk perceptions
- Income and risk perception never modelled together in causal way

## What II: Hypotheses
### H1(2): Economic vulnerability (health risk perceptions) predict compliance.
### H3: Individuals face a trade-off between preserving their health and their economic security.

## Where: Malawi during waves 1 & 2 of C19

## How: Challenges of traditional econometric approaches I

![](media/Screenshot%202025-03-04%20at%2021.02.23.png)

## How: Challenges of traditional econometric approaches II
### Strengths
- Interpretability
- Causal pathway identification

### Limitations
- Exogeneity concerns
  - Either RCT or
  - Quasiexperimental approach difficult with income
  - Controlling requires many functional assumptions

## How: Challenges of machine learning
### Strengths
- Very flexible re functional forms
- Can handle large amounts of covariates

### Limitations
- Overfitting concerns
- Causal pathway interpretation challenging

## How: Double Debiased Machine Learning
### Flexible ML to model covariate effect on treatment & outcome
- Predict outcome/ treatment seperately given vector of covariates using ML methods

### Orthogonalised regression on residuals to estimate causal effect of treatment and outcome
- *leftover variation of `treatemnt`* -> *leftover variation of `outcome`* 
  - Given no OVB
- Based on Neyman (19XX)


## How: Double Debiased Machine Learning II
### Cross-fitting to reduce overfitting and regularization bias
![](media/dmlcrossfit.png)

## With: Malawi High Frequency Phone Survey
### World Bank Malawi high frequency phone survey between 2020 and 2024
- Subset: 05/20-07/21
  - Only the first 13 rounds contain information about non-pharmaceutical mitigation behaviour
- Nationally representative sample of households based on the Malawi National Integrated Household Panel Survey from 2019
- 1729 participants at baseline & 8% attrition at R13
- Further weighting based on census data

## Why: Contributions
### Emprical contribution
- First causal investigation into health/income trade-off in context of protective measures during a pandemic
- Qunatification of trade-off and comparison over time

### Theoretical Contribution
- Empirical test of widely-assumed trade-off assumption

### Policy relevance
- Informs more efficient data collections during early phases of emergencies
- Informs ressource allocation efficiency
